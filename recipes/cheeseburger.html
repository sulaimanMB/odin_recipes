      A cheeseburger is a hamburger topped with cheese. Traditionally, the slice
      of cheese is placed on top of the meat patty. The cheese is usually added
      to the cooking hamburger patty shortly before serving, which allows the
      cheese to melt. Cheeseburgers can include variations in structure,
      ingredients and composition.
