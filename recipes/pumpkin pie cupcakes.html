      steps
      <ol>
        <li>
          For the cupcakes: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven, and
          preheat to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners,
          and coat the liners and the top of the tin with cooking spray.
        </li>
        <li>
          Whisk the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder and salt together in
          a large bowl. Whisk the pumpkin puree, granulated sugar, butter, eggs,
          milk and vanilla together in a medium bowl. Pour the pumpkin mixture
          into the flour mixture, and gently fold until just incorporated (it's
          OK if there are some lumps).
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake until the tops spring back when pressed, 24 to 28 minutes,
          rotating the tin halfway through. Let the muffins cool in the pan for
          a few minutes, then transfer to a rack to cool completely. (The
          cupcakes can be made up to 2 days before and refrigerated in an
          airtight container.)
        </li>
        <li>
          For the pie crust cutouts: While the muffins are cooling, cut out 12
          shapes from the pie crust, and arrange them on a parchment-lined
          baking sheet. Brush each with milk, and sprinkle generously with
          granulated sugar. Bake until deep golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes,
          rotating the baking sheet halfway through. Let cool completely.
        </li>
        <li>
          For the filling/topping: Beat the cream cheese and confectioners'
          sugar together in a medium bowl until smooth. Add 1 cup of the cream,
          and beat until soft peaks form. Add the remaining 1 cup cream, and
          beat until stiff peaks form. Transfer the mixture to the prepared
          pastry bag.
        </li>
        <li>
          To fill and top the cupcakes: Use a teaspoon or a melon baller to take
          a small scoop out of the top center of each cupcake (save these
          cupcake pieces). Squeeze some of the filling/topping into each hole,
          and top with one of the cupcake pieces. Pipe a swirl of the
          filling/topping on top of each cupcake. (The cupcakes can be
          refrigerated for up to 2 hours at this point if you prefer them
          chilled.) Gently push a pie crust cutout into the frosting of each
          cupcake, and serve.
